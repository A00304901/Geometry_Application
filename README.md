# Geometry_Application

First of all, I have made a repository named Geometry_Application and then created a sln file.

In the next step, I have created the class library named Geometry_Application_lib, console app and test library.

due to the error, I was not able to submit the assignment on time.

I have added logic for the sqaure, rectangle and triangle.

Now I am getting perfect output for test library and class library.
